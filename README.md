# pavlov-server-pc-container

This repository produces OCI compliant Pavlov PC Game Server containers (these are hosted on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/intunderflow/pavlov-server-pc)

These are the same containers I'm using inside PavlovHosting.com, and I've ran these successfully on top of containerd.

It's worth noting this container doesn't ship with any configuration files, you're expected to mount these into the container yourself.
